julia0.6.4 + cuda-Knet, precompiled packages needed to run Knet vgg example (Images, etc)
does not use an external volume for packages

Dockerfile adapted from JuliaGPU by Tim Besard

1. Avoid making an external volume, install package under /pkg inside this image/container.
Advantage: single file to keep track of (disadvantage: missing packages must be added on each run...)
2. Add extra packages via precompile.jl
3. Run the Knet vgg example, precompiling more packages
