# ONE TIME: add this alias to your .bash_aliases, logout, log back in to pick it up:
alias r-docker='docker run -p 8888:8888 -it --rm --user root -e NB_UID=$(id -u) -e NB_GID=100 -e GRANT_SUDO=yes  --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/home/jovyan/work noisebrain/datasciencenotebook-aib start.sh bash'

# ONE TIME:  docker pull noisebrain/datasciencenotebook-aib

# pick a working directory, go there in the terminal
# cause the .ipynb or .r file to be in the working directory

# make a PROCESSED subfolder, put the r_input.csv file there
> mkdir PROCESSED
> mv r_input.csv PROCESSED

# to be safe, make your working folder read/writeable by other.
# the uid/gid stuff _should_ make this unnecessary
> chmod -R o+rw .

> r-docker
# brings you to a bash shell inside the docker container. run "jupyter lab"
jovyan@2b3fc7a4eeef:~$ jupyter lab

# this prints out a string like:
8888/?token=ed72a192d4e95b2d606d47d2fc938c8e787ae483125d0d3b&token=ed72a192d4e95b2d606d47d2fc938c8e787ae483125d0d3b
# paste this into the browser url, prepended with localhost:
# URL = localhost:8888/?token=ed72a19...

# your working directory is mapped to /home/jovyan/work inside the container/notebook
# (This is the standard jupyter/docker user)
# You should be able to open .ipynb or .r file in the working directory

# When done, ^C in the original terminal,
# this shuts down the jupyter-r kernel.
# Then ^D to exit docker (edited)
